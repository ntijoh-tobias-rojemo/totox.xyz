            <li>Target damage value modifiers</li>
          </ol>
          <h4>Damage modification calculation</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>Sum of "#% increased damage" modifiers</li>
            <li>Product of "#% more damage" modifiers</li>
          </ol>
          <h4>Rounding</h4>
          <p>Always round towards what the value was before modification, so when you reduce a value, round up,
            otherwise, round down</p>
          <h4>Attribute modifier</h4>
          <p>The modifier of an attribute is equal to (Attribute - 10)/2.</p>
          <h4>Rolls and tests</h4>
          <p>If you need to roll an attribute, roll a d20, if the result is lower than that attribute, you succeed,
            otherwise you fail.</p>
          <p>If you need to test an attribute, however, you instead roll a d20 and add that attribute's modifier to the
            roll and compare it to the test's difficulty class (DC), rolling lower than the difficulty class results in
            a fail, otherwise you succeed.</p>
          <h4>Death</h4>
          <p>When your HP would be reduced to lower than 0, you reduce it as much as possible and test CON against a DC
            equal to the damage past 0 you would take. If you fail, you die. If you roll a 1, you fail regardless, if
            you roll a 20, you succeed regardless and gain 1d4 HP.</p>
          <h4>Casting spells and overexertion</h4>
          <p>You may not cast spells with ENR costs greater than your maximum ENR. You may, however, cast spells with
            ENR costs greater than your current ENR, if you do this, you spend all your remaining ENR and must roll for
            overexertion.</p>
          <p>To roll for overexertion, test INT against a DC equal to the ENR you would have to spend past your current
            ENR. If you fail, you pass out for 2d10 hours. If you roll a 1, you fail regardless, if you roll a 20, you
            succeed regardless and gain 1d4 ENR.</p>
          <h4>Rolling damage</h4>
          <p>The damage is rolled before modifiers are applied.</p>
          <h4>Minimum attributes</h4>
          <p>The minimum attributes are the minimum optimal attributes, you may use weapons even if you have at least
            half the listed attribute, weapons used this way deal half damage and take all your actions to use.</p>
          <h4>2-handing</h4>
          <p>Most weapons can be 2-handed. When 2-handing a weapon, your strength is considered to be twice as high for
            the purpose of determining minimum attributes</p>
          <h4>Dual wielding</h4>
          <p>Most weapons can be equipped together with another one, while doing so, you may use either of the weapons
            to attack, and your PRY multiplier is the lowest of the two weapons.</p>
          <h4>Unarmed attacks</h4>
          <p>If you don't have any weapon equipped, you may make an unarmed attack. An unarmed attack has a base damage
            of 1d4 and a base speed of 1. Unarmed attacks cannot be parried. You have a PRY modifier of 0.5 if you have
            no weapons equipped.</p>
          <h4>Range</h4>
          <p>The range of an attack determines the maximum reliable range. If you target a space further away, roll a
            d20 for each additional space. If any of the results are 1:s, the attack misses.</p>
          <h4>Creating spells</h4>
          <p>In order to create a spell, you need a recipe and the required ingredients, the recipe can have any length
            and is made with any number of your discovered aspects, the aspects used determines what the spell does.</p>
          <h4>Spells and effects</h4>
          <p>A spell consists of a number of effects. When creating a spell, you will instantly learn the first effect.
            To discover additional effects, you must either research, spending downtime equal to the effect number
            you're researching*10, or simply discover it through playing. Effects are numbered from the initial effect
            starting at 0, so the first effect you'd discover would have a value of 1, and thus a cost of 10 hours.
            There is no material cost to researching.</p>
          <h4>Aspects and experimenting</h4>
          <p>Spells are created with aspects. Each aspect has a tier, with 1 being the commonly known ones, and the
            higher tiers being more and more rare. You all already know all tier 1 aspects, but in order to learn more,
            you need to experiment or learn from someone else.</p>
          <p>To experiment, you need 5ml of alchemical compound, it takes 10h total to perform an experiment. An
            experiment consists of picking 2 already discovered aspects, and combining them to create a third. All
            combinations of two tier 1 aspects yield a result, but any other combination has a risk to fail, resulting
            in no new aspect.</p>
          <h4>Skills</h4>
          <p>There are two types of skills, attribute skills and class skills. Class skills are unique to your class,
            you start with one class skill point and you can gain more from major party achievements, class points are
            specific to your party and are not lost upon death. Class points are used on your class skill tree.</p>
          <p>Attribute skills are gained from your class and race, as well as through two ways during the campaign. One
            way is through exploring new major landmarks, these points are not lost upon death, the other way is through
            character experiences, and these points are lost upon death.</p>
          <p>Attribute points are used to gain one of three randomly chosen skills, the only exception to this is
            charisma, for which all points give +1 Charisma.</p>
          <h4>Threat level</h4>
          <p>The threat level is a measurement of the danger you're currently in. It is increased by 1 at the end of
            each turn, or by 3 if there are no enemies on the map. Some enemies have additional ways they can affect the
            threat level or be affected by it.</p>

          <h4>Initiative</h4>
          <p>At the start of combat, each player and monster type rolls initiative. To roll initiative, roll a d20 and add your DEX modifier, the one with the highest roll goes first in turn order, followed by the rest in descending order. In case of a tie, the aggressing side goes first, and ties within the same side are decided through the tied players’ choice.</p>
          <h4>Actions</h4>
          <p>On your turn, you have 3 action points by default, you may use these action points as well as your movement points in any order. Each action you take uses action points equal to that action's speed. Many sources of additional action points require you to use them for specific types of actions.</p>
